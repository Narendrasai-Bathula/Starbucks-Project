Data scientist at Udacity Nanodegree Capstone Project

This repository has all the code and reports for my Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Capstone project.

## Starbucks Capstone Challenge: Using Starbucks app user data to predict effective offers

### 1. Services
This project was written in Python, using Jupyter Notebook in Anaconda. The Python packages relevant for this project are the following:

Panda
- numb
- mathematics
- Json
- sklearn.model_selection (train_test_split module)
- sklearn.preprocessing (StandardScaler, PolynomialFeatures)
- from sklearn.tree (DecisionTreeClassifier, DecisionTreeRegressor)
- sklearn.ensemble (RandomForestClassifier)
- sklearn.metrics (mean_squared_error, rating_report)
- sklearn.linear_model (Ridge)
- Now
- sklearn.model_selection (GridSearchCV)
- matplotlib

### 2. Motivation of the project
This project is the Capstone project of my Data Scientist nanodegree with Udacity. As nanograde students, we have the opportunity to participate in the Capb Starbucks Challenge.
For the challenge, Udacity provided simulated data that a member's mandate is the main predictor of the effectiveness of an offer. Further studies could indicate which average holding days would result in an effective BOGO offering.



### 3. File descriptions
This repository contains 4 files. My project report is called "Starbucks Capstone Challenge: Using Starbucks app user data to predict effective.ipynb offers."
The data used in the project are available in the portfolio.json, profile.json and transcript.json files.

### 4. Licenses, authors, thank you, etc.

The data for the coding project were provided by Udacity.
